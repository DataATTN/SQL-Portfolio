# In this SQL, I am querying a real-world data set using an SQLite database with Python to analyze a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health
for the city of Chicago.

# Connect to the database

%load_ext sql

import csv, sqlite3

con = sqlite3.connect("socioeconomic.db")
cur = con.cursor()
!pip install -q pandas==1.1.5

%sql sqlite:///socioeconomic.db

# Store the dataset in a Table

import pandas
df = pandas.read_csv('https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/jcxq-k9xf.csv')
df.to_sql("chicago_socioeconomic_data", con, if_exists='replace', index=False,method="multi")

# Verify that the table creation was successful

%sql SELECT * FROM chicago_socioeconomic_data limit 5;

# How many rows are in the dataset?

%sql SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chicago_socioeconomic_data;

# How many community areas in Chicago have a hardship index greater than 50.0?

%sql SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chicago_socioeconomic_data WHERE hardship_index > 50.0;

# What is the maximum value of hardship index in this dataset?

%sql SELECT MAX(hardship_index) FROM chicago_socioeconomic_data;

# Which community area which has the highest hardship index?

%sql select community_area_name from chicago_socioeconomic_data where hardship_index = ( select max(hardship_index) from chicago_socioeconomic_data ) 

# Which Chicago community areas have per-capita incomes greater than $60,000?

%sql SELECT community_area_name FROM chicago_socioeconomic_data WHERE per_capita_income_ > 60000;

# Create a scatter plot using the variables `per_capita_income_` and `hardship_index`. Explain the correlation between the two variables.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

# As the Per Capita Income rises the Hardship Index decreases. 
# The points on the scatter plot are somewhat closer to a straight line in the negative direction, so we have a negative correlation between the two variables.
