# In this project, I am querying a database containing employee information (string patterns, sorting, and grouping).
# I first downloaded the information consisting of five CSV files and created a database in MySQL with five tables.
# I then imported the data to each corresponding table. Lastly, I was able to perform analytics on the data using the following SQL queries.

-- Retrieve all employees whose address is in Elgin,IL

SELECT
    F_NAME,
    L_NAME
FROM
    EMPLOYEES
WHERE
    ADDRESS LIKE '%Elgin,IL%';
    
-- Retrieve all employees who were born during the 1970's

SELECT
    F_NAME,
    L_NAME
FROM
    EMPLOYEES
WHERE
    B_DATE LIKE '197%';

-- Retrieve all employees in department 5 whose salary is between 60000 and 70000

SELECT
    *
FROM
    EMPLOYEES
WHERE
    (SALARY BETWEEN 60000 AND 70000) AND DEP_ID = 5;

-- Retrieve a list of employees ordered by department ID

SELECT
    F_NAME,
    L_NAME,
    DEP_ID
FROM
    EMPLOYEES
ORDER BY
    DEP_ID;   

/* Retrieve a list of employees ordered in descending order by department ID 
and within each department ordered alphabetically in descending order by last name*/ 

SELECT
    F_NAME,
    L_NAME,
    DEP_ID
FROM
    EMPLOYEES
ORDER BY
    DEP_ID
DESC
    ,
    L_NAME
DESC
    ;

-- For each department ID retrieve the number of employees in the department

SELECT
    DEP_ID,
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY
    DEP_ID;

-- For each department retrieve the number of employees in the department, and the average employee salary in the department

SELECT
    DEP_ID,
    COUNT(*),
    AVG(SALARY)
FROM
    EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY
    DEP_ID;

-- Label the computed columns in the result set of SQL problem 2 (Exercise 3 Problem 2) as NUMEMPLOYEES and AVGSALARY

SELECT
    DEP_ID,
    COUNT(*) AS "NUM_EMPLOYEES",
    AVG(SALARY) AS "AVG_SALARY"
FROM
    EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY
    DEP_ID;

-- In SQL problem 3 (Exercise 3 Problem 3), order the result set by Average Salary

SELECT
    DEP_ID,
    COUNT(*) AS "NUM_EMPLOYEES",
    AVG(SALARY) AS "AVG_SALARY"
FROM
    EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY
    DEP_ID
ORDER BY
    AVG_SALARY;

-- In SQL problem 4 (Exercise 3 Problem 4), limit the result to departments with fewer than 4 employees

SELECT
    DEP_ID,
    COUNT(*) AS "NUM_EMPLOYEES",
    AVG(SALARY) AS "AVG_SALARY"
FROM
    EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY
    DEP_ID
HAVING
    COUNT(*) < 4
ORDER BY
    AVG_SALARY;
